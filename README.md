# MHControl
This is a small Raspberry Pi application written in C.   
MHControl is a part of my home control system that is mainly using Arduino and ESP devices.    
MHControl has two main purposes
 * listen to UDP status messages send by any My Home Control devices
 * listen to the camera stream of the front yard CCTV camera and store the captures videos in the local Synology disk station

MHControl can used by other devices as well to store debug messages in a file on the Raspberry Pi.
